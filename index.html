<h1>StatSite.</h1>
<p>This fresh new site is what everyone has been waiting for. We at StatSite have been struggling for a long time. We had no way to efficiently see young athletes stats and see them progress throughout their carrers. So, we decided to create a website where youth to even pro athletes can record their stats and get their names out there. Togther with Theo's Rankings we plan to make the athlete's journey at least a little bit easier.</p>
